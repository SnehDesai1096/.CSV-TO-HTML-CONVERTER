# .CSV-TO-HTML-CONVERTER
This is a basic code that would convert your .csv file and provide the output in html format.



This is the code to convert the .csv file to html format.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This code is not fully automated. You need to manually enter the file name inside the code
that you need to convert to html format.

2. Also this code would not generte a new file, but it would correctly convert the file if you run the 
the file in your IDE.


In the further Upgrade of this repo I will make it completely automate. But, for now hope this helps you..
